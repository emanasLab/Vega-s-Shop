# shop

A new Flutter project.
Hello Abdu🙂, This is a mini ecommerce app focuced on how to use providers and integrate APIs and organize The data layer
Thus, i made it as simple as this, a shoping page where there's items we can add to cart,
and cart page to manage the quantity and finally pass the order and move to payment.

note: other than basics i learned that in one provider we can put different data, (i used that in my stock provider to store "new arrivals" list and "for you" list,
i learnt that consumer can be amazing for when a part of the widget is changed not the entire widget
and at the other hand storing in a variable and use it when u need can be cool context.watch<CartProvider>() but that require you to rebuild the whole widget everytime you change that variable.

ps: components like drawers, buttonApp i ignored them for now since i only focused on fuctioning providers
